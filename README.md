# medical-bot

## Introduction

Inspired by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan where a lot of potential patients couldn't be properly diagnosed due to the limitation of medical resources, we propose to build a **Web-based Medical Bot**, in which the users can upload medical images and get an initial diagnosis of what they have. We will be using machine learning and image processing techniques to build, train, and test our models.
